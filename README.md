# Bank

## Description

Well, this project belonged to me some time ago and I said to share it with you.

Here you will find an almost complete bank with the necessary details in Java

Somehow in this project I had to use the [entity framework](./DataLayer/entity) to relieve myself of additional code, and to a very small extent I was able to implement this framework in Java using the different code I found.

> In this project, I used the design of the repository pattern, if I said the name correctly

## Getting Started

You need to know a little about compiler and jvm, this project uses sqlite for the database,
then use the [driver](./Driver) that I put in front of you and explain that driver to the editor you are using 
or if you run the code directly from the terminal

> Then go to the this [**class**](./ConsoleView/menu/Menu.java) and run the main method

`Enjoy`
