# Bank

## Description

Well, this project belonged to me some time ago and I said to share it with you.

Here you will find an almost complete bank with the necessary details in Java

## Getting Started

You need to know a little about compiler and jvm, this project uses sqlite for the database,
then use the [driver](./Driver) that I put in front of you and explain that driver to the editor you are using 
or if you run the code directly from the terminal

`Then go to the this `[**class**](./ConsoleView/menu/Menu.java)` and run the main method`
